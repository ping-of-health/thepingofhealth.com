## Problem Statement 1

I have many home devices (IoT).
How do I know if all my devices are patched?

Do I know even know many devices I have?

## User Story:

As a homeowner of many devices, 
I want to know which home devices are outdated and vulnerable to known exploits, 
so that I can patch them.

## Audience:

Tech savvy (multiple devices)
+
Security aware (wants to get latest patch)
+
Not security trained (easy to use)


## Possible Solution

A mobile app that scans the home network and gathers information necessary to check if devices are updated to the latest version and notifies the user.
